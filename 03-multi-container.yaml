# ELK stands for:

# âœ… Elasticsearch â€” Search and analytics engine (for storing and searching logs).
# âœ… Logstash â€” Data processing pipeline (for collecting, transforming, and sending data).
# âœ… Kibana â€” Visualization and dashboard tool (for analyzing and visualizing data).

# Together, ELK is a powerful stack used for log management, monitoring, and troubleshooting in DevOps environments. ðŸš€
